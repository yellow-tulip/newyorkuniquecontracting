The project was placing pavers around a spa tub and the whole backyard that was initially dirt and weeds. The owner of this business advised me on the design best suited and suggested adding surrounding flower beds for both beauty and drainage purposes. The paver trim around the tub was attractive and saved me money. His workers were neat and respectful. I would definitely recommend and certainly use them again for another protect . When recent heavy rains occurred a few days after the project was completed and a few pavers sunk (not an uncommon occurrence and not related to their work), he arrived the next morning to fix them.\""},

Tee's team has a wide range of proficiencies, including masonry, waterproofing and brick work. Tee explained the work he recommended for each job and gave me options which was extremely valuable and rare. The pricing was very fair and attention to detail was excellent. When I had something I wanted adjusted or explained, Tee was always responsive and came to meet me at the house as quickly as he could.
