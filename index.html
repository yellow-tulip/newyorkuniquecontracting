After 2024 winter the cement started to break apart, after this winter 2025 it’s even worse and I'm embarrassed every time I step outside my home and see my driveway and sidewalk. When I complained to the owner he came by February of 2024 to discuss the issue I'm having. He told me that he could never guarantee the quality of the cement. I shot back that he never once stated this prior to taking my money which amounted to over $20,000 which I took out a loan because I wanted this work done. The owner then suggested i call the cement company and make a complaint regarding the quality of cement. My response was that I did not sign a contract with the cement company i signed a contract with New York Unique contractors. He stated that he would speak to his provider and get back to me. This was 12 months ago! Be careful with this company!”"},{"author":"jc guitarist","source":"Google","rating":"5 Stars","text":"“They did such an incredible job on my backyard deck.

So when I needed my front yard and sidewalk cemented, I didn't just get bids but I also paid attention to HOW the contractors interacted with me. Spoiler alert: New York Unique Contracting is top notch and I would use their services again in a heartbeat. Absolutely one of my best experiences with a contractor... Out of 10 contractors that I contacted about the job, New York Unique stood above the rest for their customer service, construction knowledge, organization, and quality work. Tee knows how to run a business. He is a punctual man of his word and very reasonable with his pricing. When he wasn't available his sons, Danny & Adil, stepped right in and made sure everything went smoothly and on time... Their crews are so quick and efficient that they finished both jobs way ahead of schedule. I am thrilled with the quality of the work they did on my yards and am more than happy to vouch for their professionalism and fantastic work. Tee, Danny & Adil, thank you for such a great experience!”"},{"author":"Michael Frank","source":"Google (4 reviews)","rating":"5 Stars","text":"“I had Danny and Tee come out to completely redo our back yard in ditmas Park brooklyn.
