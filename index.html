In one week they transformed our 600 sq ft cracked and nasty concrete patio into a bluestone paradise. They were professionals, and stopped to ask our input at each step, from the stone layouts to the concrete ramps to drainage considerations. It was by far the best experience we've had working with contractors in NYC.\""},

The project was placing pavers around a spa tub and the whole backyard that was initially dirt and weeds. The owner of this business advised me on the design best suited and suggested adding surrounding flower beds for both beauty and drainage purposes. The paver trim around the tub was attractive and saved me money. His workers were neat and respectful. I would definitely recommend and certainly use them again for another protect . When recent heavy rains occurred a few days after the project was completed and a few pavers sunk (not an uncommon occurrence and not related to their work), he arrived the next morning to fix them.\""},

Having experience with prior contractors, I was pleasantly surprised at the efficiency and quality of work Tee (the owner), his son and his crew offered us. Tee's team has a wide range of proficiencies, including masonry, waterproofing and brick work. Tee explained the work he recommended for each job and gave me options which was extremely valuable and rare. The pricing was very fair and attention to detail was excellent. When I had something I wanted adjusted or explained, Tee was always responsive and came to meet me at the house as quickly as he could. This is a family business and they really care about their work and take pride in the end result. I am glad I found them!!\""},

We had about 4 people quote us and they had the most reasonable price and were the only ones who gave us the option of getting brick and granite tiles. They were super professional and worked incredibly quickly - they told us the front steps would be done within a week and they finished in 2 days! They also clearly take pride in their work because the results look amazing. We are already planning to use them again for future projects.”"},
