> "Danny and Tee were recommended to me by Kong's, a masonry shop in Brooklyn. In one week they transformed our 600 sq ft cracked and nasty concrete patio into a bluestone paradise. They were professionals, and stopped to ask our input at each step, from the stone layouts to the concrete ramps to drainage considerations. It was by far the best experience we've had working with contractors in NYC."

> "Wonderful job on my backyard! Not only was the work perfect but the advice on design was stunning! The project was placing pavers around a spa tub and the whole backyard that was initially dirt and weeds. The owner of this business advised me on the design best suited and suggested adding surrounding flower beds for both beauty and drainage purposes. The paver trim around the tub was attractive and saved me money. His workers were neat and respectful. I would definitely recommend and certainly use them again for another protect . When recent heavy rains occurred a few days after the project was completed and a few pavers sunk (not an uncommon occurrence and not related to their work), he arrived the next morning to fix them."

Having experience with prior contractors, I was pleasantly surprised at the efficiency and quality of work Tee (the owner), his son and his crew offered us. Tee's team has a wide range of proficiencies, including masonry, waterproofing and brick work. Tee explained the work he recommended for each job and gave me options which was extremely valuable and rare. The pricing was very fair and attention to detail was excellent. When I had something I wanted adjusted or explained, Tee was always responsive and came to meet me at the house as quickly as he could.

And they came, gave a free estimate and explained how they would work on my house and gave a really negotiable price and was able to give me a really good deal. I was really happy to work with them and they provided me with all insurances. They gave quality work and my wife was really happy since she is very picky with what she wants. I would highly recommend them to anyone who needs good quality work. I would give them 5 stars any day. Thats how much satisfied my family is with their work. Dont hesitate to contact them."

They were super professional and worked incredibly quickly - they told us the front steps would be done within a week and they finished in 2 days! They also clearly take pride in their work because the results look amazing. We are already planning to use them again for future projects.”

> “So two years after New York Unique cemented my driveway and sidewalk by the attached pictures you will see i am forced to have the work redone. After 2024 winter the cement started to break apart, after this winter 2025 it’s even worse and I'm embarrassed every time I step outside my home and see my driveway and sidewalk. When I complained to the owner he came by February of 2024 to discuss the issue I'm having. He told me that he could never guarantee the quality of the cement. I shot back that he never once stated this prior to taking my money which amounted to over $20,000 which I took out a loan because I wanted this work done. The owner then suggested i call the cement company and make a complaint regarding the quality of cement. My response was that I did not sign a contract with the cement company i signed a contract with New York Unique contractors. He stated that he would speak to his provider and get back to me. This was 12 months ago! Be careful with this company!”

> “Fake reviews, these guys are absolutely horrible. Will give you fake pricing and charge a bunch of things at the end, use very cheap material when doing the job and charge you an arm and a leg for it. Extremely unprofessional. STAY AWAY!’
> **Response from the owner:** Hello sir/madam sorry to hear about your complaint, is it possible you can share your address of the property and the pictures of work we have done for you, so i can cross verify that you’re talking about our company or mistaking us with another company. I’m asking for all this because i couldn’t find your profile on google making sure your profile is not fake.

> “As a homeowner of more than 15 years, I've had my share of contractor woes. So when I needed my front yard and sidewalk cemented, I didn't just get bids but I also paid attention to HOW the contractors interacted with me. Spoiler alert: New York Unique Contracting is top notch and I would use their services again in a heartbeat. Absolutely one of my best experiences with a contractor... Out of 10 contractors that I contacted about the job, New York Unique stood above the rest for their customer service, construction knowledge, organization, and quality work. Tee knows how to run a business. He is a punctual man of his word and very reasonable with his pricing. When he wasn't available his sons, Danny & Adil, stepped right in and made sure everything went smoothly and on time... Their crews are so quick and efficient that they finished both jobs way ahead of schedule. I am thrilled with the quality of the work they did on my yards and am more than happy to vouch for their professionalism and fantastic work. Tee, Danny & Adil, thank you for such a great experience!”
