### 2.2. Weaknesses

-   **No Digital Presence:** No website, leading to a complete lack of control over branding, lead generation, and the online narrative.

-   **Incomplete Profiles:** Lacks a formal Google Business Profile.

### 2.3. Opportunities

    -   *NYC Unique Construction*
    -   *NYU: Unique General Contracting of USA* (affiliated with Small Business Attorney NYC)
    -   *Unique Contracting* (unclaimed on Yelp)
-   **Negative Review Misattribution:** A single 1-star Google review claiming theft is for a different company but is hurting their reputation.
